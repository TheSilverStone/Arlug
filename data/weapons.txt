Tractor beams utilize repulsor technology to allow ships to attract space debris to them, be that the ores from a recently mined asteroid, or the dumped cargo from a merchant ship fleeing for its life. This has led to tractor beams being a popular outfit among asteroid miners and pirates alike."

	description "The Meteor Missile is the cheapest and simplest homing weapon available in human space, with only rudimentary infrared tracking systems that can have trouble homing in on targets with low heat levels. True to its name, the missile reaches a very high speed to leave its target's anti-missile defenses with little time to react. The trade-off is maneuverability, so Meteor Missiles are practically useless against agile targets farther than point-blank range."
	description "	Pods enable fighters and other light craft to carry small quantities of missiles into battle while retaining enough space for other weapons. Large ships are better off with full-size launchers."

While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

	description `In an act that would make Dr. Richard J. Gatling spin in his grave with the ferocity of the barrels of his invention, the Gatling Turret was born when a resourceful pirate thought to replace the Energy Blasters on a Blaster Turret with a pair of Gatling Guns. Ever since, the dominion of the Gatling Turret has spread across the Southern Rim, terrorizing merchants and law enforcement alike with its unparalleled ability to tear apart the hulls of ships.`
